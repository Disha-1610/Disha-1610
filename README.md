# 👋 Hi there, I'm Disha Nayak
I’m an undergraduate student with a strong interest in Machine Learning and Computer Vision, focused on building practical AI-driven applications. I enjoy working on projects that involve image understanding, deep learning-based feature extraction, and deploying ML solutions through modern development workflows.

I aim to develop skills that bridge the gap between academic learning and real-world industry applications.

## 🚀 Expertise
I have hands-on experience in developing Computer Vision and Machine Learning projects, particularly in areas such as face analysis, clustering, and real-time image processing.

Some of my key project work includes:

Face Clustering System, using face embeddings and unsupervised clustering to group similar identities

Invisible Cloak Application, built with OpenCV techniques like background subtraction and masking

In addition to model development, I have experience deploying ML applications as APIs. I deployed my Face Clustering project using Flask-based REST APIs, hosted on Railway, and integrated Cloudinary for efficient image storage and management.

I am interested in building scalable ML systems and continuously improving my understanding of applied AI engineering.
